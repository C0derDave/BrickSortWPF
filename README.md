# BrickSortWPF
This application lets you input a LEGOÂ® set ID and then downloads the inventory for that set. The application then lets you see all the parts required to build that set, and allows you to keep track of which parts you have for that set.

To function, there needs to be a file named key.config containing ONLY your Rebrickable API key in the same folder as the exe.
